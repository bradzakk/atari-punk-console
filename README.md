## Synopsis

The source files I used to creating a Atari Punk Console. Mainly covers the creation of a singled sided PCB design that uses two 555 IC timers. If you are wondering what a Atari Punk Console is you can find out by visting http://www.ataripunkconsole.com/ 

## Motivation

The main motivation was to learn how to layout and produce PCB designs to my specifications,I plan to cut the PCB on my small homemade CNC. Also the Atari Punk Console is a fun little project.
